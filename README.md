## FAQ
### When is this system or portal supposed to be used? 
This portal is meant to be used after the process in Team Tailor has been completed. 
So the recruiter is supposed to be able to do all the steps in this place after the candidate has been hired. 

### Who is this website for? 
The target group is the recruiters. 

### Does this have back-end functionality? 
No it doesn't but can always be added. 

### What is the JavaScript scrips doing?
They are just for the purpose of having a visual representation of the different functionalities. 
The scripts are to show that a candidate can be manually added, that you can search for candidates in the search bar and lastly, to open the pop-up box for Bertie Bean who is the first in the list of candidates to show his onboarding process stage. 

### Who owns this website prototype? 
The people at Knowit Connectivity has the ownership of this.  
I (Claudia J√§ger) created it but you are free to edit, delete or add code at any time. 

### What are we seeing when we open the website? 
You are seeing a design proposal for a portal where the recruiter is able to see all new candidates in one place. 
Where one is able to do things both manually and automatically depending on each candidate's individual process. 
I know that the recruitement process is never linear and so this is just a starting point in automating the recruitment process
and how it could be improved in the future. 

### How do we go from here? 
I think the best way forward would be to really interview all the different types of recruiters, how they work,
what are their biggest struggles and so on. From there on the portal definitely needs back-end functionality, like a database 
to properly store all candidates and correctly be done so.
